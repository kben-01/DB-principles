1. A database is a place where JSON objects can be stored for later use.
-databases are needed in order to seperate data from one another for a better website experience.

2. Many things can be stored in a database but for the most part they are used to store data and valuable info. This could be a users login information or movies on IMDB.

3. Hierarchical databases, Network databases, Relational databases, Object-oriented databases, Graph databases, ER model databases, Document databases, and NoSQL databases.

4. Depending on what kind of data you want to track would change which type of database you would use. Say you were ranking a list of objects and some had higher importance than others, you would use a hierarchial database to keep track of the order of the data you stored.

5. A query is a request for specific data or data-types.

6. Encryption is a way of scattering data in a specific way so that only those who have worked on the page or are owners of the page can understand. This is used as a security method to try and keep hackers out or confused.
-Encryption is important at a database level because that is usually where all the important data is stored.

7. Object permanence is knowing that an object can exist somewhere even though you cant see it.

8. Your database can live either within your web page or somewhere outside of it maybe on another application like mongoDB or something like that.
